My app, EasyWay, is in progress, and while it's made significant strides, there are some minor debugging errors that need to be resolved.
I faced issues navigating through the 'ReportActivity' and 'MapActivity' sections to ensure a structured design. 
I am working on fixing this to improve the appâ€™s functionality and user experience (UX). 
I aim to complete the app and fix the syntax and logical issues by December 2024.
