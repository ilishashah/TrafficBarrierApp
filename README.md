My app, EasyWay, is currently still in progress, and while it's made significant strides, there are some minor debugging errors that need to be resolved from my end.
I faced a lot of issues navigating through the 'ReportActivity' and 'MapActivity' section to make the design structured.
I am actively working on fixing this to improve the appâ€™s functionality and user experience. 
I aim to finish the app and fix the syntax and logical issues by December 2024.
